"""
Quarantined FBref pull via soccerdata.

FBref is currently marked as hard-blocked by Cloudflare in DEVELOPMENT.md.
Do not run this script as part of the active pipeline unless that project
constraint is deliberately changed.

Original intent: pull FBref national team stats via soccerdata.
Targets: WC 2026 qualified nations across recent qualifying cycles,
         UEFA Nations League, CONMEBOL qualifiers, etc.

Saves:
  data/raw/fbref/<league>_<season>_<stat_type>.parquet
  data/derived/fbref_team_stats.parquet   (team-level per match stats)
  data/derived/fbref_player_xg.parquet    (player-level xG, national team comps only)
